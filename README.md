## Overview

TtYT (Talk to YouTube) is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based
Question-Answering system for YouTube videos that you can run locally.
It uses Youtube-DL to get the transcript (or captions) for a video,
and then uses [Vectara](www.vectara.com) to set up the Retrieval and Generation
Systems on top of it.

Right now you can talk to one video at a time, but it is easily extendible (PRs)
welcome! to talk to multiple videos, a whole channel or a combination of
channels!

## Usage

### 1. Get the code and requirements

Clone the repo, install the requirements in `requirements.txt`:

```
python -m venv ./ttyt_venv/
source ./ttyt_venv2/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create a Vectara account

Sign up for a [Vectara account](https://console.vectara.com/signup). The free
tier should be enough for even the larger videos you want to talk to. Once
you're logged in, create a corpus (you can name it anything) and note the
Corpus ID (you'll need it for step 3).


Also note your customer ID:


And create an API Key from the "API Access" tab in the menu that we will use to
index the data and query it (make sure you give it both query and indexing access):


### 3. Talk to Youtube!
In the terminal you are using to run the program, define the following variables
that will be used by the program:


```
export CUSTOMER_ID=YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID
export CORPUS_ID=YOUR_CORPUS_ID
export API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

```

Then simply start the program with:
```
python talk_to_youtube.py --video-url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNVuIU6UUiM
```

Note that the program works well for videos with manual subtitles. For some
reason for videos with auto-generated captions YoutubeDL puts all the downloaded
captions under one timestamp which can cause issues.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to talk to another video, its best to either create
a new corpus in the Vectara console or clear the data in the existing corpus to
avoid data overlap between multiple videos. This will be a flag when running
the program in the future so it will automatically create a new corpus if
desired.
